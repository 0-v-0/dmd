The keyword `body` is now deprecated

The keyword `body`, used when a function / method has contract,
has now been deprecated, and `do` should be used instead.
Using `do` in place of `body` has been supported since 2.075.0,
after DIP1003 was accepted.
At the same time, `body` was made a contextual keyword,
but kept being non-deprecated due to its prevalence.
According to the deprecation process, `body` will be removed
from the language in release 2.101.0 at the earliest.
