The default linker for the Digital Mars tool chain is now optlink.exe

The default linker when building with -m32 under Windows has been changed
from link.exe to optlink.exe to avoid calling the wrong linker when both
the Digital Mars tool chain and the Microsoft compiler tools are found in
the PATH environment variable.
