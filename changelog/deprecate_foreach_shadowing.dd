Deprecate allowing shadowing in foreach loops

Up until this version it was allowed to shadow a variable in a `foreach` loop, although
it is dissallowed in a normal `for` loop. This patch makes the behavior of the `foreach`
loop consistent with the `for` loop one. To fix any issues encountered, rename the variable
inside the `foreach` body that shadows the one from the upper scope.
