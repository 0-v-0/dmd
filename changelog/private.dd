Deprecate the use of selectively imported private members

$(LINK2 $(ROOT_DIR)spec/attribute.html#visibility_attributes, The specification states) that a private member
is visible only from within the same module.
Prior to this release, due to a bug, private members
were visible through selective imports from other modules, violating the specification.
Beginning with this release, accessing private members from outside the module
in which they are declared will result in a deprecation message.
