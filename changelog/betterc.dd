$(TT -betterC) enhancements

Many improvements were added to the dmd's $(TT -betterC) implementation, most
notably programs compiled with $(TT -betterC) will no longer reference unused
druntime symbols, asserts are implemented as C `<assert.h>` calls, and phobos is
not linked by default.

See the $(LINK2 $(ROOT_DIR)spec/betterc.html, Better C) specs for more details.
