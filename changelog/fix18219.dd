Fix Issue 18219 - Private import inside struct leaks symbols when used as VarDeclaration types

When implementing a struct which has a local private import
the imported symbols are leaked if present in a VarDeclaration statement. For more information and examples see : https://issues.dlang.org/show_bug.cgi?id=18219

Symbols from the private import should not visible outside the
struct scope. A deprecation is now issued when such cases are
encountered
