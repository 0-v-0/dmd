Windows: dmd can now detect Visual Studio installation paths

dmd now determines the environment variables that are usually set if the "Command Line prompt for Visual Studio" link is used to open a console window (or vcvarsall.bat is executed). This includes Windows SDK directories and Visual C library directories. When compiling with -m64 or -m32mscoff this allows dmd to invoke the linker without having a Visual Studio version preselected by the installer.

In particular, the variables WindowsSdkDir, WindowsSdkVersion, UniversalCRTSdkDir,
UCRTVersion, VSINSTALLDIR, VisualStudioVersion, VCINSTALLDIR and VCTOOLSINSTALLDIR are
determined from the registry if they are not set in the environment or sc.ini.

Supported Windows SDK range from 7.0A to 10.x, supported Visual Studio Versions are
VS 2008 to VS 2017. If multiple versions are installed, highest versions are preferred.
