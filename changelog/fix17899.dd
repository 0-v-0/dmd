Fix issue 17899 - Allow delegates to be initialised at compile time

delegates may now be initialised at module scope. This changes the effect of the fix for 13259 (turning the ICE that resulted into an error) making the follow legal:
---
void delegate() bar = (){};
---

The function pointer is set to the function of the delegate, the context pointer is set to null.
