HexString literals are now obsolete

$(LINK2 http://dlang.org/spec/lex.html#HexString, HexString literals) are obsolete.

Prior to this release, usage of hex string literals would emit a deprecation warning.  Starting with this release they will emit an error.

Use $(LINK2 https://dlang.org/phobos/std_conv.html#hexString, `std.conv.hexString`) instead.
