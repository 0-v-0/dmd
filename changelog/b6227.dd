Comparison of values belonging to different enums is deprecated.

This change does not affect anonymous enumerations.

---
enum Status
{
    good,
    bad
}
enum OtherStatus
{
    ok
    no,
}

// Deprecated - Even though both good and ok evaluate to 0 they belong to
// different enumeration types
static assert(Status.good == OtherStatus.ok);
