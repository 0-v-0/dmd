Deprecate conditional expression followed by an assign expression

If a conditional expression is the left operand of an assign expression,
then one of them should be parenthesized:

---
bool test;
int a, b, c;
...
test ? a = b : c = 2;   // Deprecated
(test ? a = b : c) = 2; // OK
test ? a = b : (c = 2); // OK
---

This makes the intent clearer.
