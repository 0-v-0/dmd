The deprecation for read-modify-write operations on `shared` variables has ended

Read-modify-write operations are not allowed for `shared` variables:

---
shared int i;
i++; // Error: read-modify-write operations are not allowed for shared variables
---

Use $(REF atomicOp, core, atomic) instead:

---
import core.atomic : atomicOp;
shared int i;
atomicOp!"+="(i, 1);
---
