Windows: Visual C++ and the Windows SDK are no longer required to build 64-bit executables

The Windows installer now adds platform libraries built from the MinGW definitions and
a wrapper library for the VC2010 shared C runtime. When building COFF object files with
`-m64` or `-m32mscoff` and no Visual Studio installation is detected or
no platform libraries are found these will be used as replacements. If the Microsoft linker
is not found, the LLVM linker LLD will be used.
