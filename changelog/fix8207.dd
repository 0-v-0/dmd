D ABI change on Win32 and OSX targets

The compiler has been updated to prefix all `extern(D)` symbols with an extra
underscore where the platform expects one on all external symbols. This allows
compiled code to work better with binutil programs, such as the ability to list
symbols demangled inside a debugger.

This is an ABI breaking change and requires recompiling libraries.
